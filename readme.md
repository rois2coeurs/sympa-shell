## Quick description

sympa-shell is a pretty cool shell :) It's very simple but effective! When you are in a git folder you will see the branch you are currently in. This project is still under development and is destined to evolve.

## Installation Guide

Clone the depot via `git clone https://github.com/rois2coeurs/sympa-shell.git` or just download it one zip format.

Now that you have unzipped or clone the depot you have 3 files :

The only one we are going to use is installSympaShell.sh. But we need to modify the permissions to launch it via `chmod 755 installSympaShell.sh`

Now we can launch the installation via `./installSympaShell.sh`.

You have nothing to do the installation is automatic.
