## Quick description

sympa-shell is a pretty cool shell :) It's very simple but effective! When you are in a git folder you will see the branch you are currently in. This project is still under development and is destined to evolve.

The only one we are going to use is installSympaShell.sh. But we need to modify the permissions to launch it via `chmod 755 installSympaShell.sh`

Now we can launch the installation via `./installSympaShell.sh`.

You have nothing to do the installation is automatic.
